Originlly created as a throw away repo for class demo in CSCS1320S22 C / C++ Programming, it's been decided keep it and use it for class project.

The only project proposal received was from Ash regarding an online chat multiplayer game. The original concept included implementation as a Discord bot. In the NoLiB spirit, it was decided to put the Discord UI aspect on hold and begin with a C/C++ client/server implementation.
